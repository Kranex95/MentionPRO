# MentionPRO
A plugin to mention and be warned with a sound and messages.

With this script you can be notified by means of a sound or messages when you are mentioned. I got the idea for this from Discord, which when using the @ symbol and putting the user's name, the script is in charge of checking if the user exists/is online and if so, it notifies it through a chat message , by means of a message in the middle of the screen (title) and/or by means of a sound.

In addition to being able to configure the mention symbol (@), you can also configure the default sound of the plugin and the sound of each user, through command or menu.
